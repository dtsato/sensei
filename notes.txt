first steps
* create separate repo for minesweeper kata, with iteration commits
* 

other things to tidy up
* how many iterations? - can we query the git repo for tag names?

infrastructure for cukes/specs?

gem management
* gem install sensei
* sensei init minesweeper
* cd minesweeper
* sensei run

* there is a repository of known kata
* sensei init 'kata-name' clones the git repo with iterations
